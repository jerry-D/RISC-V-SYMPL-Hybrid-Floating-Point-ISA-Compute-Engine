                                ;The following program demonstrates usage of the new RISC-V/SCE hybrid instructions.  The exemplary Verilog RTL model of the 
                                ;RISC-V/SCE hybrid Instruction Set Architecture Compute Engine depicted in the first Page of this Preliminary Information sheet
                                ;comprises a RISC-V (RV32I) core gene-spliced to qty. (2) SYMPL Compute Engine cores, SCE(0) and SCE(1), forming a RISC-V/SCE 
                                ;hybrid Compute Engine, with such cores being able execute the same hybrid instructions.
                                ;
                                ;SCE(0) and SCE(1) are identical in all respects, except SCE(1) does not include the SYMPL Fused Universal Neural Network (FuNN)
                                ;operator or the human-readable Pseudo-Random Number Generator that SCE(1) has.  The purpose of SCE(1) being included in the instant
                                ;implementation is to demonstrate the RISC-V hybrid core's ability to push programs and/or data into two or more SCEs, set or clear 
                                ;hardware breakpoints, single-step, launch and multiple SCE cores simultaneously.  The Verilog test bench that is included with the 
                                ;distribution package available for free download at the SYMPL Compute Engine repository here: www.github.com/jerry-D
                                ;begins by first loading the RISC-V hybrid's program memory that the RISC-V executes to orchestrate the processing that the SCEs are 
                                ;to perform.  Next, the test bench loads the RISC-V hybrid's data memory with the program that the SCEs are to execute, followed by the 
                                ;test bench loading the data file that SCE(0) is to process.  While SCE(1) does not include a FuNN operator, this same data file is 
                                ;simultaneously pushed into it as well, mainly for the purpose of demonstrating simultaneous loads by the RISC-V hybrid.
                                ;
                                ;The program that is to be pushed into both SCEs simultaneously the RISC-V hybrid is a simple neural network classification routine
                                ;that SCE(0) executes to classify qty. (16) objects using SCE(0)'s on-board FuNN operator.  SCE(1) executes the same program, 
                                ;but since it has no FuNN operator with which to perform the required operations, SCE(1) will eventually get trapped in a loop that 
                                ;attempts to read a result when there is none.
                                ;
                                ;Once the test bench pushes both the program and the data files into the SCEs, it releases RESET, allowing the RISC-V hybrid core to run 
                                ;its program.  Once those things are accomplished, the test bench will sit and wait for an indication that the RISC-V/SCE hybrid Compute Engine
                                ;has completed processing, at which point the test bench writes formats and writes the results to two files in the Vivado simulation directory
                                ;for that project.  The two file names are “assayPullForm.txt” and “randomNumbers.txt”. 
                                ; 
                                ;The file assayPullForm.txt” is a formatted, human-readable report showing the results of the neural network routine that SCE(0) computed
                                ;using its on-board FuNN operator.  The file “randomNumbers.txt” is an unformatted, is a list of qty. (256) human-readable floating-point 
                                ;pseudo-random floating-point numbers in decimal character sequence format that the RISC-V hybrid pulled directly from SCE(0)'s on-board PRNG.
                                ;RISC-V Launching SCEs.  During RESET active, the SCE's force-break bit is automatically set to active, thus when RESET is released, 
                                ;the force-break in each SCE remains set, forcing each SCE to enter a continuous hardware break state.  The main purpose of this is to allow 
                                ;an opportunity for the RISC-V hybrid to push a program and data into the SCEs, in that upon power-on reset, the SCE program memories have 
                                ;nothing in them for the SCEs to execute.  Once programs and data have been pushed into the SCE's, the RISC-V hybrid then simultaneously 
                                ;clears both SCEs' force-break bit by executing the XCLRBRK hybrid instruction immediately followed by the XSSTEP hybrid instruction. 
                                ; 
                                ;This short sequence clears both SCEs' force-break bits, thereby allowing both SCEs begin executing their own programs now residing in 
                                ;their own program memories.  The XSSTEP instruction following the XCLRBRK instruction is necessary because, while XCLRBRK does clear the SCE's 
                                ;force-break bit, the SCE will remain in a hardware break state until it is explicitly “stepped” out of that state by the RISC-V hybrid using the 
                                ;XSSTEP instruction.
                                ;
                                ;The first part of the SCE neural network classification program initializes various SCE registers, which in this case, is necessary because
                                ;the SCE just came out of RESET state.  Once these few registers have been initialized, the SCEs then encounter a software breakpoint 
                                ;residing at location 0x0000010A in the SCEs' program memory.  The RISC-V hybrid's routine anticipates this and therefor waits for this to 
                                ;happen by polling SCE(0)'s status bits using the XSTATUS hybrid instruction.  
                                ;
                                ;Once the RISC-V hybrid detects that the software breakpoint has been encountered, it then simultaneously modifies both SCE program counters
                                ;to point to the entry point of the SCEs' neural network classification routine, which is location 0x0000010C in SCE program memory.  
                                ;The RISC-V hybrid also simultaneously pushes into both SCEs' Auxillary Register r (AR4), the number of objects SCE(0) is to classify, which, 
                                ;in the case is “16”, in that SCE(0) classification program expects that its AR4 contain the number of objects to classify.
                                ;
                                ;After the RISC-V hybrid simultaneously modifies both SCE's program counter, the SCEs immediately begin executing the neural network 
                                ;classification program using the data that the RISC-V simultaneously pushed into their data memories.  While the SCEs are busy performing 
                                ;the classification routine, the RISC-V is continually polling SCE(0) status bits for a “Done” condition.  When the classification routine 
                                ;is completed by SCE(0), it sets is “Done” bit to signal this fact, at which point the RISC-V detects this and begins pulling results from 
                                ;SCE(0)'s output buffer located within SCE(0)'s data memory and storing it in RISC-V data memory space using the XPULL hybrid instruction.
